                Journalist and writer based in London, specialising in politics, culture, and identity. I've written on British parliamentary politics for a number of outlets, including Huffpost and the Independent, where I often focus on the Labour party. I’ve also reported on international affairs, interviewing anti-government activists in Kolkata for a Prospect dispatch earlier this year.

                I’m constantly looking for stories around how nation, race, and community operate in today’s world, which also informs my cultural criticism. I’ve written about contemporary theatre for Exeunt, and on photography for the Financial Times where, as an intern, I wrote about pop music and worked across the newsroom. My interview with Dr. Gareth Davies featured in the end-of-decade special edition of The Sunday Times, and I’ve reported on youth culture and music trends for Dazed and the Quietus.
